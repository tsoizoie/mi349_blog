        <h2>About Zoie Tsoi</h2>
        <p>I am not a media expert, in any way.</p>
        <p>My whole life has been about creating media. I am a dancer, an artist, a programmer, a designer, and much more. I love watching movies and I love editing.</p>
        <p>This blog is a way for me to talk about all my favorite things and my thoughts on media. Movies have always been a big part of my life. I used to grow up with movie nights every Saturday and I dreamed of being in the film production industry one day. Nowadays, I am studying Games and Interactive Media, hoping to be in the game programming field.</p>
