            <h3>Why <em>Everything Everywhere All At Once</em> Hits Home For Gen Z</h3>

            <p><em>Everywhere All At Once</em> is a beautiful, cinematic film and I believe that it is a love letter to life, humanity, and to the ideals of Gen Z.  In a time where our future is uncertain and we feel as though we are barrelling toward inevitable failure and the end of the world no matter what we do, our generation has adopted the ideology of optimistic nihilism. This A24 film explores nihilism, absurdism, and many more themes in a way that isn&apos;t too in your face.</p>

            <p>In the movie, Jobu Tupaki has seen and experienced everything in the universe and has concluded that nothing matters, so what is the point of living? She seeks out her mom, Evelyn, so that she can share her experiences and see if Evelyn has a different perspective, in an attempt to try and prove to herself that there is meaning behind life. Instead, Jobu just drags Evelyn into her ideology, making them both jaded and detached to life. In the end, Evelyn&apos;s husband Waymond is the one that convinces Evelyn and in turn, Jobu. Waymond is the beacon of hope; he lives just to live and be happy, just wanting to love those around him. Nothing in the world makes sense or really matters, but the fact that people choose to love each other in a meaningless world, gives life meaning. I believe that Gen Z has the ideology that nothing matters, so you might as well try your best to be happy and live your life. We all die eventually, so why does it matter what we do? We can do what we want and create our own meaning for life.</p>

            <h3>Intergenerational Trauma in Movies and Who It's For</h3>

            <img alt = "Turning Red Movie Still of Ming and Mei" src = "Turning Red movie still.jpg" width = 600px class = "center"/>
            <p>I am a Chinese-American daughter of immigrant parents and I watched <em>Everything Everywhere All At Once</em> and <em>Turning Red</em> with my mom. She didn&apos;t get either movie, while I thought those movies changed my life. I found that this was a common experience for many other second-generation Asian-Americans. </p>
            <p>After watching <em>Everything Everywhere All At Once</em>, I had hoped my mom would see the parallels in our relationship compared to Joy and Evelyn&apos;s relationship. The ending message of understanding between the mother-daughter duo in the movie was all I ever wanted with my mom, but she didn&apos;t understand or internalize the themes shown to us in the last two hours. Instead, she said the movie was confusing and too much. </p>
            <p>Similarly, <em>Turning Red</em> resonated with me and not my mom. This Disney movie explores another mother-daughter relationship and their struggle with independence. Mei&apos;s mom, Ming, is overprotective of her daughter, especially as she is in the period of gaining the ancestral ability to turn into a red panda. We learn that this overprotection is because of the mom&apos;s bad experience with the ability and how her family dealt with it when she was a teenager. However, this intergenerational trauma gets put on Mei, as Ming refuses to be understanding of Mei's situation and tries to control her decisions. In the end, Ming learns to let go and allow Mei to make her own choices. Again, my mother did not see the parallels in our relationship with Mei and Ming&apos;s relationship, so the hope of her finally understanding my decisions and struggle with independence was defeated.</p>
            <p>However, intergenerational trauma isn&apos;t new, since it is intergenerational. So why do these films only resonate with our generation? Maybe if our parents saw these films before they became parents, it would resonate differently.</p>
